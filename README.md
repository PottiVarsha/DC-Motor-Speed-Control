# DC-Motor-Speed-Control
This repository contains the code for a DC Motor Speed Control Monitoring System. The system uses an Arduino to control and monitor the speed of a DC motor, sending real-time data to a ThingSpeak channel. A web dashboard is provided to visualize the motor's duty cycle, voltage, speed, and state using different types of charts.
# Features
- Real-time data fetching from ThingSpeak
- Visual representation of duty cycle, voltage, speed, and motor state
- Responsive design with two cards per row
# How to Use
- Clone the repository.
- Open index.html in a web browser.
- Modify the JavaScript to include your own ThingSpeak API key and channel ID.
